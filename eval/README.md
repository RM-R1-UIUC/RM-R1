The evaluation code has been tested under the following environment:

pytorch=2.6.0cu12.4+
transformers=4.51.0
vllm==0.8.3


Note that the latest transformers and vllm have potential conflicts (so please to make sure). There is no need to do pip install -e . (the code handles the directory dependencies for you).
