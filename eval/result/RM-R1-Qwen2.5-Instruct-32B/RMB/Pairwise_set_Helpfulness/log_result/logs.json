        "content": "Here is a summary of CS50 lecture 5 on data structures:\n\n- Data structures allow us to organize and store data in computers in efficient ways. They are fundamental to programming.\n\n- Arrays allow storing multiple values of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Arrays have a fixed size and accessing elements is fast via indexes.\n\n- Linked lists store elements non-contiguously by linking each element to the next via pointers. They are dynamic and can grow/shrink. Traversing a linked list is slower than arrays as elements are not contiguous. \n\n- Stacks follow LIFO (Last In First Out) order. New elements are added to the \"top\" of the stack and removed from the top. Useful for functions calls, undo operations etc. \n\n- Queues follow FIFO (First In First Out) order. New elements are added to the \"back\" of the queue and removed from the front. Useful for scheduling, printing, resource sharing etc.\n\n- Hash tables store key-value pairs and allow fast lookup, addition and removal of elements via hashing of keys. Great for implementing dictionaries, maps etc. Collisions are handled via chaining or open addressing. \n\n- Binary search trees store elements in a hierarchical tree structure to allow fast lookup, insertion and deletion of elements. Balanced trees like AVL and red-black trees ensure fast average performance.\n\n- Selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quicksort algorithms were discussed as examples of sorting data in arrays and linked lists. Big-O analysis was used to analyze algorithm efficiencies.",

Arrays: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are useful for storing large amounts of data, but they have limited capacity and can be inefficient for inserting or deleting elements.\n2. Linked Lists: A linked list is a collection of elements, each of which points to the next element in the list. Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, but they can be slower to access than arrays.\n3. Trees: A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node has a value and zero or more child nodes. Trees can be used to represent a variety of data structures, such as hierarchical relationships, decision trees, and balanced trees.\n\nThe lecture also covers common operations that can be performed on data structures, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search. Time complexity is introduced as a way to measure the efficiency of these operations, with a focus on big O notation.\n\nFinally, the lecture discusses the importance of data structure selection, emphasizing the need to choose the appropriate data structure for the problem at hand.\n\nHere are some key concepts and terms from the lecture:\n\n* Data structures: Arrays, linked lists, trees (binary trees, AVL trees, B-trees)\n* Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal, search\n* Time complexity: Big O notation, worst-case, average-case, best-case\n* Data structure selection: Choosing the appropriate data structure for the problem at hand\n* Trade-offs: Space vs. time, simplicity vs. efficiency\n\nThe lecture also includes examples and demonstrations of how to implement data structures in C, including a simple array, a linked list, and a binary search tree.",
